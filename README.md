Gillian's Color Tastic Day Scheduler

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
When the user opens the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. They are presented with time blocks for standard business hours (and a few extra for those who work overtime), and each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The user can click into a time block, type in an event and press the submit button at the end of the block, which saves the text to local storage. If the user refreshes the page, the saved events will persist, unless he or she deletes the event manually, by erasing the text and clicking the submit button again.
